## cloudflare and nuxt

$ yarn create cloudflare (with yarn 1 installed globally)
ara-team, sets the local directory and pages project name in the dashboard; use hyphen, not space
Framework Starter, category
Nuxt, framework
y, yes to install nuxi@3; didn't get asked the second time through these steps
no, don't use git for version control; going to drag created files into this existing repository
yes, deploy to cloudflare; add domain after that in the dashboard

## tailwind

https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/installation
$ yarn add -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss

and then you did have to add this manually to nuxt.config.ts:
	modules: [
		'nitro-cloudflare-dev',
		'@nuxtjs/tailwindcss',//from nuxt tailwind
	],

## fonts

./nuxt.config.ts
./tailwind.config.js
./assets/css/main.css
./pages/index.vue
