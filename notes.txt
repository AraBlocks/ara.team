## cloudflare and nuxt

https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/

$ yarn create cloudflare (with yarn 1 installed globally)
ara-team, sets the local directory and pages project name in the dashboard; use hyphen, not space
Framework Starter, category
Nuxt, framework
y, yes to install nuxi@3; didn't get asked the second time through these steps
no, don't use git for version control; going to drag created files into this existing repository
yes, deploy to cloudflare; add domain after that in the dashboard

## tailwind

https://tailwindcss.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/installation
$ yarn add -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss

and then you did have to add this manually to nuxt.config.ts:
	modules: [
		'nitro-cloudflare-dev',
		'@nuxtjs/tailwindcss',//from nuxt tailwind
	],

## fonts



https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans


https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/ginto-rounded





oh, also, let's say the browser needs to display a character that is not a part of ginto rounded
will it fall back to noto sans, even on text that is styled to show ginto rounded?



font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
