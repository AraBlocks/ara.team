	Auth.js uses an essential cookie üç™ to store and verify the OAuth handshake
	when twitter or whatever provider redirects back to /api/auth/callback,
	Auth.js writes a signed session token into this cookie so that it can confirm,
	here on the server, which user just authenticated

	if we were using Auth.js for all our user identity and browser session management,
	we'd keep this cookie around, and update it, but as we're only using Auth.js to let people prove
	they are billgates at twitter, or whatever, we don't need it after the oauth flow is done

	but we set its expiration to 4 minutes, rather than zero, just in case zero might mess something up
	with some provider now, or cause an error later, if a provider changes something on their end
	those kinds of errors can be really hard to identify and diagnose

	by default, Auth.js sets these secure attributes on its cookie
	HttpOnly:  true       prevents JavaScript (including page scripts & extensions) from accessing it
	SameSite:  "lax"      only sent on top‚Äêlevel navigations (e.g. the OAuth callback redirect), but not on cross-site subrequests
	Secure:    true       only transmitted over HTTPS connections, not HTTP
	Path:      "/"        sent on every request to our domain
	Domain:    (omitted)  defaults to the exact host serving it; third‚Äêparty domains cannot read or send it
	*/
	session: {
		maxAge: 240,//4 minutes in seconds, how long Auth.js‚Äôs cookie will last
		updateAge: 0,// tell Auth.js to never refresh this cookie; it will expire naturally shortly
	},
	secret: access.get('AUTH_SECRET'),//Auth.js needs a random secret we define to sign things; it should be 32 bytes of random so like 64 base16 characters; and we don't have to rotate it
})

//when code reaches here, the person at the browser connected to our server is signed into google, has told google they want to use their google account with our site, and auth.js running on our server has confirmed all of this is correct with google
function proofHasArrived(token, profile, account) {

	account.provider//will be like "google" or "twitter"

	//these four auth core normalizes and includes, although some can still be null some times
	profile.id//should be the id set by the provider for this user that doesn't change, even if the user changes their info there
	profile.name//user name
	profile.email//email, if the user has one with this provider
	profile.image//url to avatar image, but we're not going to use this

	//beyond that are the extra and custom ones we pulled out of the raw responses above
	profile.email_verified//true if google, and user has email there, and user verified that email with google
	profile.username//twitter's simpler route-style name, "billgates" rather than profile.name "Bill Gates"

	/*
	At this point:
	1) Look up or create your own User in the database.
	2) Issue your own long-lived session cookie or JWT for your application.
	3) Redirect the browser back into your app‚Äôs UI.
	Auth.js‚Äôs cookie will expire on its own in 4 minutes, and you never call /api/auth/session,
	so Auth.js won‚Äôt attempt any further validations.
